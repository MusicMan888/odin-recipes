        <h2>Mom's Cheese Strada</h2>
        <p>This recipe is from the family cook book, more like a family tradition vs family recipe,
            Something my Mom made for Christmas morning that could be popped in the oven, and served 
            to everyone, Champagne optional for the adults, perhaps a non alcoholic version for the kids.
            It got everone in the spirit for opening gifts, and then a nice Christmas nap.
